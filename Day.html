                <h2>Introdution</h2>
                <p>Well it's rolacoster of emotions of something i think i know before and having start all over again just to pracitice is right all thanks to ALX. left for me i will be looking for options to work for myself without having a skillable career in tech. so yes, the ego, the lessons and so much more, but i am learning all over again and i  believe i can do it better this time around since i am aware of the damanges i have done to myself earlier. and thanks to God i got the opportunity no longer telling my younger self but practicing it.</p>
